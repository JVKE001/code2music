        <h2>Ariana Grande's Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Ariana Grande is an iconic American singer, songwriter, and actress
          known for her powerful voice and impressive vocal range. Rising to
          fame as a child star on the TV show Victorious, she transitioned into
          a global pop sensation with hits like "The Way," "Problem," and "Thank
          U, Next." Her unique blend of pop, R&B, and soul influences has earned
          her numerous awards, including Grammy Awards and Billboard Music
          Awards. With her dedication to music and exceptional performances,
          Ariana Grande has established herself as one of the biggest pop stars
          of her generation.

        <h2 class="section-title">Ariana's Fame Song</h2>
        <p>
          "Save Your Tears" is a song by The Weeknd, originally released on his
          2020 album After Hours. The song became even more popular when Ariana
          Grande joined for a remix in April 2021. Lyrically, the song is about
          regret, heartbreak, and missed chances in love. The Weeknd sings about
          seeing an ex-lover who once cried over him, but now she’s moved on. He
          realizes his mistakes but knows it’s too late to fix things. Ariana’s
          verse in the remix adds another perspective, making it feel like a
          conversation between two ex-lovers.
